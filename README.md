## IDENTIFICATION OF ATTACKERS USING BLOCKCHAIN TRANSACTIONS USING CRYPTOGRAPHY METHODS

### Introduction
    A blockchain is a continuously growing list of records called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. The best way to think about block contains  a hash a digital hash is like a fingerprint of some data. So the block here has its own hash and then the previous hash which is contained within the block as a reference is actually the hash of the block that came before it.
    
#### Genesis Block
The first block called the Genesis block and it's called jazzes block because after the block chain is initialized that block will always stay blocking them on forever and ever and ever for eternity it will never change.

##### Workdone:
Firstly, in the terms of the confidentiality using encryption algorithms such as AES. There are mainly two types of encryption –
Symmetric-key encryption 
Public-key (asymmetric) encryption 
###### In Blockchain applications, we use cryptographic hash functions such as SHA-256 
The hash is always 64 characters long and it consists as you can see if not just from digits but actually from letters as well. The 5 requirements for Hash algorithms:
1.	One Way
2.	Deterministic
3.	Fast Computation
4.	The Avalanche Effect
5.	Must Withstand collisions

####### Distributed P2P Network:

 In this P2P N/W, attack one block change and change the values there.The hacker will have to attack all of the block chains and at the same time.Its very difficult for the attacker to change the data of all the computers.For eg: suppose attacker change data only for the 1 computer and then after these change he coundn’t able to change the data for remaining computers because of some n/w error or system blocking.Now, Administer can easily find the change of data about one computer and find some mashup here.Means this system had hacked by some attacker. Because rest of the same data for all the computers. So, here identification of Attacker take place.
